# Awesome Prompt Engineering!

This site provides great resources and well formed prompt engineering samples that you could use with image models like [OpenAI's Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) or text models like [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3/).

Prompt Engineering means giving the model a prompt, or description of the task, rather than just letting it implicitly figure it out. This is done by converting the task into a prompt-based dataset and then training a language model with this new information.

Dall-E 2 is an [Inverted CLIP model](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/the-dall-e-2-multimodal-learning-in-image-generation-45d8ebbb1dc0#:~:text=DALL%C2%B7E%202%20model&text=The%20DALL%C2%B7E%202%20includes%20an%20inverted%20CLIP%20model.,to%20produce%20an%20image%20embedding.).
GPT-3 is a [Generative pre-trained transformer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3).
